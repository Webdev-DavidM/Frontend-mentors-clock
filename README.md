# Frontend Mentor - clock solution

## Overview

This project required me to replicate an application using prototypes provided
in Sketch in mobile, tablet and desktop sizes. I downloaded the sketch files and
used them develop the application.

## Features

  less mode ).s
- Based on the time of day the application will show a daytime or nighttime
  theme ( dark or light mode ).
- Press the more or less icon for the screen to slide up/ down to review/hide
  information.
