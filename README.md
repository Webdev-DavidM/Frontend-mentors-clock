# Frontend Mentor - clock solution 


## Overview

This project required me to replicate an application using prototypes provided in Sketch in mobile, tablet and desktop sizes. I downloaded the sketch files and used them develop the application.

## Features

-  Press the refresh icon to load a new quote ( The quote is only viewable in less mode ).
-  Based on the time of day the application will show a daytime or nighttime theme ( dark or light mode ).
-  Press the more or less icon for the screen to slide up/ down to review/hide information.
